Overview:
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL, where we analyze a given dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. By leveraging SQL queries, we will clean, manipulate, and visualize data to facilitate informed decision-making.

Objectives:
-Import and preprocess data in MySQL.
-Perform descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
-Identify missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
-Use SQL queries for data summarization, filtering, and aggregation.
-Generate insights using joins, subqueries, and analytical functions.
-Create visualizations using MySQL-integrated tools or external BI tools.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Handling NULL values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
Data Exploration: Computing measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
Data Aggregation: Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, SUM.
Trend Analysis: Identifying key patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Data Visualization: Using MySQL queries to extract insights and visualize results via Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) or BI tools (Tableau/Power BI).

Technologies Used:
-MySQL (for data storage and analysis)
-SQL Queries (for data extraction and manipulation)

Expected Outcome:
A detailed report/dashboard showcasing key insights derived from MySQL queries, enabling data-driven decisions based on the analyzed dataset.
